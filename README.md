Today, web and online media have become the quickest and most straightforward approaches to get data. In this age, surveys, sentiments, inputs, messages and suggestions have become a critical wellspring of data. Because of the progression in advancements, we are currently ready to remove important data from such information utilizing different Natural Language Processing (NLP) procedures. NLP, a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI), utilizes a computer and human characteristic language to yield important data. NLP is generally utilized in content arrangement assignment, for example, spam location and opinion investigation, text age, language interpretations and archive order.

### Introduction
The aim of the project is to employ TensorFlow2 to build a spam detection model in SMS. Specifically a binary classification model is to be developed which will output whether a given message is spam or ham. To make the aforementioned model we use Dense Networks, LSTMs and Bi-directional LSTMs.

### Dataset
The dataset for the project is downloaded from the UCI datasets. The dataset consists of 5574 text messages. This dataset was specifically collected for the purpose of mobile phone spam research with each text being labelled as either 'spam' or 'ham'.
